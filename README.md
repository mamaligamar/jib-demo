## Run demo application
```mvn clea install```

List the docker images and elect the one that has a tag and the name you gave to your image:

```docker images```

Set up a container with the created image:

```docker run -p 8080:8080 -d your_image```

Then when you run localhost:8080 you will see a table filled with books data.

# DEMO JIB plugin
This project is a simple springboot project which aim is to illustrate how **jib** plugin works. This plugin generates a docker image for our project. Then we just have to set up a container with that image and we have the app running.

More information about jib plugin is available in the following links:

## Housekeeping
If too much images were generated by the plugin you can use one of the following docker commands in order to clean old and untagged images:

```docker rmi image_name```

Or remove all the dangling images (no more related with any tagged image):

```docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)```
